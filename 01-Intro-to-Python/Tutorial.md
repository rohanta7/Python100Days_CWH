# Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?
## What is Programming
Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. 
If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. 
How about 23453453 X 56456?

You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same. 
This 100 days of code series will help you learn python from starting to the end. We will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a Job ready Python developer!

## What is Python?

- Python is a dynamically typed
  - You don’t need to declare variable types explicitly.
  - Type is decided at runtime, not in advance.

-   General purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.
    Python is not limited to just web, data, or system programming.
    It can be used in:
    -> Web development (Django, Flask)
    -> Data Science / Machine Learning (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
    -> Scripting, automation, testing
    -> Game development, IoT, and more
-   Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.
    -> Code is executed line-by-line by the Python interpreter.
    -> Unlike compiled languages (like C++), you don’t need to compile the code separately.
    -> Abstracts away low-level details like memory management.
-   It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989. 

## Features of Python

-   Python is simple and easy to understand.
-   It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.
    -> It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux — no need to change code.
       Write once, run anywhere!
-   Python is an open-source programming language.
-   Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy(numerical computations), Tensorflow(machine learning), Selenium(web automation/testing), OpenCV(computer vision),Matplotlib, Pandas, Flask, PyTorch ..etc.
-   It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.
    -> Python can work with C/C++ via ctypes, Cython, or PyBind11
    -> Java (via Jython)
    -> .NET (via IronPython)
    -> R (via rpy2)
    -> SQL databases (via sqlite3, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
    

## What is Python used for

-   Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.
-   Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.
-   It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.
-   It is used to create web applications.
-   It can be used to handle databases.
    -> ORM(Object Relational Mapping) is like a translator between Python and your database. Tools like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM allow you to write Python code instead of SQL to work with databases.
-   It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.
